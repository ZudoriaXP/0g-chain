### [Telegram](https://t.me/web3_0glabs) | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/0glabs)

</div>

Reference implementation of 0G Chain, the first modular AI chain. Built using the [cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).

<!---
## Mainnet

The current recommended version of the software for mainnet is [v0.25.0](https://github.com/Kava-Labs/kava/releases/tag/v0.25.0) The master branch of this repository often contains considerable development work since the last mainnet release and is __not__ runnable on mainnet.

### Installation and Setup
For detailed instructions see [the Kava docs](https://docs.kava.io/docs/participate/validator-node).

```bash
git checkout v0.25.0
make install
```

End-to-end tests of Kava use a tool for generating networks with different configurations: [kvtool](https://github.com/Kava-Labs/kvtool).
This is included as a git submodule at [`tests/e2e/kvtool`](tests/e2e/kvtool/).
When first cloning the repository, if you intend to run the e2e integration tests, you must also
clone the submodules:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Kava-Labs/kava.git
```

Or, if you have already cloned the repo: `git submodule update --init`

## Testnet

For further information on joining the testnet, head over to the [testnet repo](https://github.com/Kava-Labs/kava-testnets).

## Docs

Kava protocol and client documentation can be found in the [Kava docs](https://docs.kava.io).

If you have technical questions or concerns, ask a developer or community member in the [Kava discord](https://discord.com/invite/kQzh3Uv).
